Like most I was surprised that everything came in plastic bags but that did not bother me surprising yes but I thought the plastic gloves and bibs wear a little weird especially for the places atmosphere but again whatever not a big deal. I found the food ok nothing special really. You get a lot of food for your money but the calamari was kinda slimy and the shrimp and crab was over killed with garlic almost to the point that it was unediable. I love garlic but the bottom of the bags were literally a pound of melted butter and a whole garlic. Pretty disappointing we will not be visiting again RL is still the better option','2','0','1','0'),
